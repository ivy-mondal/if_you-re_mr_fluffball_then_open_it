       - If guy in 10m radius of her precious daughter:
           if mr fluffy:
              gentle smile
           else:
              mama bear mode activated: death stare!

    3. Shared Brain Cell Count:

       - Howwwwww do you two always arrive at same conclusion?!

    4. Ganging Up Frequency:
       - More often than I eat chocolate (I want chocolate waaaah!)
       - More consistent than my sleep schedule

    5. Lost Son Probability:
