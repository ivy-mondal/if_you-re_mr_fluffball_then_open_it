        Reason #3: The Superhuman Listener (a.k.a. The 'Wait, You Actually Heard That?' Factor)

        1. Attention Span:
           - Longer than a giraffe's neck
           - Can focus on my ramblings for hours without dozing off

        2. Memory Bank:
           - Recalls I stored my project in which freaking directory in my computer when I'm crying about how I can't find my project
           - Remembers all project ideas and whatever shite I'm supposed to learn while I'm busy being a lazy arse

        3. Reaction Time:
           - Responds to my messages faster than a cat to a laser pointer
           - May have developed telepathic abilities

        4. Scientific* Conclusion:
           Mr. Attentive's listening skills > World's most advanced AI + all moms combined(except my mom ofc)
           * Science conducted by yours truly while ugly crying from happiness
