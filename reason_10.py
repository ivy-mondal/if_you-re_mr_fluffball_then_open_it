        My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
        Everyone looked worse in the light
        There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven
        I'll tell you the truth, but never goodbye
        I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
        I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
        I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
        And now I see daylight, I only see daylight
